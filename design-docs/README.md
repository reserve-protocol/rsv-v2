# Design and Analysis for the RSV Basket Protocol

This folder is meant to contain design documentation, use cases, and security analysis for the RSV Basket Protocol implemented in this repository.

In general, all of this documentation should be viewed as a place to explicate and record thoughts-in-progress. Even if it looks done, it is probably incomplete.

Fundamentally, all of this design documentation is about writing correct contracts. A major operational goal of all this is to guide our testing, and to spot the level of code review that we require.
